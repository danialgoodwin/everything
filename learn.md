  - SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle
    - Planning: Input by senior developers, customers, sales
    - Requirement Analysis: Software, hardware, external (partners), data storage type, data transfer type, how is access granted, how to users use the app
    - Design: Technical/system design by developers, including risk analysis (internal and external code), security, functional specifications (input type, audit trail)
    - Implementation: Aka, development phase. Also includes testing in a 'white box' environment (think: unit tests)
    - Testing: Test in a 'black box' environment, aka as an attacker would see the system.
    - Deployment: Also check if the deployment mechanism is secure.
    - Maintenance: Lifecycle is (Monitoring > Updates > Services Packs > Critical Updates > Repeat)
    - End-of-life: Steps to remove software, don't forget any service accounts. Make sure everything is removed/deleted properly and that no new attack vectors are open once features are removed.
  - Do we really 'need' a SDLC? Quick rule-of-thumb is if the project involves more than one person
    - Advantages for using: Easy to learn, easy to use, documentation, clear picture for developers, easier maintenance, better tools, ...
    - Disadvantages for NOT using: No clear start/stop with tasks, scales poorly, code not flexible, code doesn't match users' needs, easy to skip important tasks
  - Each new feature/route opens a new potential attack vector
  - Software Development Models: Code-and-Fix (aka, no plan), Waterfall, Agile, Iterative, Spiral
  - Software Vulnerabilities:
    - OWASP
    - Input Validation, Buffer Overflow, Command Injection, and much more
  - Coding Best Practices
    - We want confidentiality, integrity, availability
    - Test only on a trusted system
    - Input validation: data types, encoding, data range, data length
    - Require authentication for all pages/resources, using standard/well-tested services, faily securely, and many other great notes in the 'Authentication & Password Management' section
  - Code Reviews
  - Demo: Use OWASP BWA (Broken Web App project), Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP (similar to Burp Suite, intercept network request/responses),

  - Code 'patterns' are a bandage for limitations/weaknesses of a framework/language (common knowledge, this is said by others too)

- 2019-05-09, meh, Secure Coding: Preventing Insufficient Logging and Monitoring, https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/secure-coding-preventing-insufficient-logging-monitoring/table-of-contents
  - Don't log too much data, but make sure there is enough to catch attackers
  - A user trying different passwords may just be somebody that forgot their password, but when also trying different user names, then that's a bigger hint to an attacker

  - OWASP: Open Web Application Security Project
  - A1 - Injection: SQL Injections, NoSQL Injection. We need better frameworks to help prevent this.
  - A2 - Broken Authentication: There have been many account/password hacks/leaks. We need to get to a place past passwords. Blacklist breached passwords.
  - A3 - Sensitive Data Exposure: Equifax. The combination of data, like: name, address, phone number, password, 
  - A4 - XML External Entities (XXE): New frameworks disable this by default. We need more DAST (dynamic scanning) and SAST (source code analysis). 
  - A5 - Broken Access Control: For example, change a number in the URL to access somebody else's data
  - A6 - Security Misconfiguration: "Passive-finding", aka without hacking. We need more scripts in CI/CD to auto-test
  - A7 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Frameworks are helping us more to prevent this
  - A8 - Insecure Deserialization: Intercepting/changing data going between client and server, aka remote-command execution. Don't blindly run any code that can touched by external.
  - A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Some dependencies may have vulnerabilities. Need to automatically check NIST for vulnerabilities, and break builds.
  - A10 - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring: We need more automatic reporting

  - With host Troy Hunt, creator of haveibeenpwned.com
  - Case study: A common Javascript library was maliciously updated with a crypto-miner (CoinHive)
  - When using a CDN (or external script), include an 'integrity' hash so that content will only be used if it is same as expected (see bottom of source for view-source:https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
    - Use caniuse.com for 'SRI' to see which browsers support this feature
  - CSP: Whitelist sites that can be used. Done via a meta tag in head: `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Polity" content="default-src 'none'; connect-src ...; font-src 'self'; frame-src ...; img-src ...; script-src 'self' ..." />`
    - Has ability to report URI to a specified address, aka report issues to site owner. But, can't do with meta tag unfortunately. Example service that will do it: https://report-uri.com/
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS): Protection in browsers is different
  - Certificate Authority (CA): 
  - CAA much better than HPKP
  - Add automatic reporting
  - Do it! Add .well-known/security.txt that has contact informtation related to security issues. See https://securitytxt.org/

  - Bubbles: Clickable circle global overlay, aka floating Activity. Full developer preview in API 29
  - System-wide dark theme. Use themes: Theme.AppCompat.DayNight, Theme.DeviceDefault.DayNight
  - Preferences: Deprecated. Use Jetpack Preferences
  - Jetpack Compose: UI via Kotlin, similar to Flutter building UIs, aka no XML
  - Kotlin-first, CameraX (replaces Camera and Camera2), Security, Architecture Components, Jetpack Preferences, 
  - No more 'findViewById(...)'
  - Privacy: External Storage, Location, Background Activity Starts, Camera, Connectivity,
